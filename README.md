# cpp-coursework
projects from C/C++ Programming (CISC 192) and Object Oriented Programming in C++ (CISC 205)

this and a few other git repos contain programs I have written for course assignments over the last year and a half. please bear in mind that some of the earliest programs are simple and undocumented first attempts at programming. for my most recent, advanced and well-documented work, please see the cpp-coursework repository, specifically any files in a sub-directory (e.g., TA_AI, PointerPower or CellularAutomata).

I am in the process of cleaning up and better documenting the repos to highlight my best work. Thank you for your patience.
